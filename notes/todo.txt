Gather data from both APIs to be able to compare which we want to use, if either.
    Update the version of MongoDB on AWS

    Curate a dataset of products to test against the API
        Use products from the suppliers of these retailers:
            Nordstrom: 1000003564
            Model: 1000004878
            ITA Group: 1000000454
        Query products using upc, sku, ean, and mpn. Make sure a valid ID is used (not null or missing). When sku or ean equal upc, use upc as the query field.

    Run the APIs against the curated data and save it, including both the query and the results
        Create a separate collections for each API query type results, including free peripheral data
            Plan all collection names

    Compare API results with our data.
        Can we uniquely identify and map the products from the API to our products?
        What information did we gain? - schema analysis

    Determine some questions that we could explore and hope to answer - data mining!
