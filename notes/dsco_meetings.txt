The APIs return results on about 25% of the products. This is too sparse to use the APIs
and confirms a fear that the data given to Dsco by the suppliers is too lean. Dsco plans
to clean the data on their end.

There is another project that involves some intellectual property rights. They will discuss
it among themselves and with Christophe before proceeding.

================================================================================
July 11, 2017

Pick a few suppliers where both products succeeded and both failed,
query a hundred or so products from each and run analysis again.

Keep thinking about what would be some interesting questions, based on the data we have and
what we ahve discussed with Dsco?

If the APIs don't work, does Dsco have enough data to be interesting to us?

================================================================================
June 28, 2017

Download the data into a spreadsheet of some kind and upload it to slack.

Analyze the results and try to figure out why the data had few positive results from the APIs.

================================================================================

Does one of the services hae holes in their data?

Can we ID our data with theirs? IMPORTANT

Suppliers are the source of product data. Retailers send order data to match up with supplier data.

SKUs in stock, randomly select products, stratified by supplier.

Group all the bad responses and analyze the problems. Was it the supplier or the service?

The supplier wants to know if the retailer is trying to dropship products.

Suppliers could want to know where their products are being sold.

TODO prove that we can correlate the data. Start with UPCs from Nordstrom.

Can we identify the products?
Do we get the data we want?
How does their data match/differ from what we have?

Dsco wants to know:
    who is selling the product
    what does the product cost to the consumer
    is there any trending product info
    physical attrs is nice, but not as important

Start with suppliers for Nordstrom, Model, ITA group
sku, upc, mpn

when using sku, if sku == upc or ean == upc, use the upc. for some clients, sku was not an option, so they filled this field with upc.

TODO
Prepare a report comparing the 2 apis by Wed. Include the available query fields and the result fields.
Also include any information that would be important to know in making a decision regarding the two options.

Querying by sku is the most import search parameter. UPC is not required by Dsco, sku is.

The api will be used to add value to the retailer. Dsco will offer extra information about the most important (to the retailer) products using the information gathered form the api.

Include examples in the DB of the results of the api calls.

separate collection for indix data

Which api is better and compare them and prepare a report for next meeting.

Both retailers and supplier have an account_id

Orders have an account_id and supplier_id. The account_id refers to a retailer_id

================================================================================

    There are tools that model collection relationships. The collections documents are structured mostly the same.

    Only dropshipping data. No data on reatailer sales

    Take on the exercise of getting extra information for the catalog. Get additional important data and see what questions we can come up with. Use semantics3 and indix for this.

communication
    slack
    contact Bruce Grant, reach out any time
    prefer slack over email

problem domain
    data exchange platform
    move to data intellifence/analytics
    faciliate saring of data between suppliers and retailers
    what is B2B?

    Inventory visibility from supplier to retailer
    purchase order to supplier
    fulfilled and shipped or canceled
    invoice/billed

    schema of required data and schema of extra data
    rqd sku and qty

    inventory visibility - usually 100%

    own the transfer of data to partners

    inventory is mostly complete. it is real inventory.
    order data is very limited. eg Nordstrom order data from Cole Haan 20% of 20% of nordstrom orders

    complete supply info. limited demand info

    only see drop shipping orders from retailer

    retailer is primary customer. retailer then invites supplier to join up. supplier could then ask reatilers to join

    Questions to answer:
        inventory data: sku, GTIN (upc, ean), (multiple identifiers), qty, estimated time of delivery, 
        catalog: brand, size, weight , dimensions, (Attributes)

    1st interesting things:
        fill in data - collect data from 3rd party and fill in supplier catalog data

***        which of my products are my retailers selling? which are they trying to sell?
***        from the retailers perspective, which of my suppliers products am I not selling that I should be?
        is the retailer listing a supplier's sku on their website to the end users. some items have no visibility
        what 3rd party data is available
        ask supplier, which skus do you think the reatilers are dropshiping?

    2nd question:
        trends for skus for demand

    start playing with data and see if there is anything there.
    have latitude to have my own thoughts


    any computed data belongs to dsco

    1600 suppliers on the platform

    most data is drop ship data, but moving to b2b data




data definition

data access
    read only copy of mongodb. always up to date. second instance which we can modify however we want.
    mongo:
    dsdb instance contains:
        account
        reatiler
        supplier
        order
    dsdbc: c stands for catalog
        item
    not relational, may be duplicated data
    nordstrom account id. jump to retailer find attr named connections. in each connection contains another account id and contains the suppliers. connections contains catalog ids. only show items in a particular catalog. ay find __all__ 
    can i now get a list of all items associated with a retailer

reporting
    weekly conference call
    Brett from dev ops
    mongo chef is useful tool
    tuesday from 9-9:30

Apr 20, 2017 - from Christophe

Everything is on AWS

3rd party DWH (Leo Analytics)
[Data model could be made available from Leo]
[data stored in different ways depending on use cases; e.g. search vs. DWH]

Extracts from change log from MongoDB, pushed into Redshift and DynamoDB
Most of the data would be in Redshift - read-only access
1 billion pieces of information per week
Data related to orders, data related to items (SKUs) [also, data related to inventory]

Flow of information and what we can understand from it

Customer data (e.g., Nordstrom) - purchase orders
Supplier data - inventory, SKUs
[suppliers have been on-boarded one at a time over the past 18 months]
Trading partner data

Shipping data (i.e., pick up location, delivery. time to delivery, etc.) in May.

Derived data - owned by Dsco (e.g., SKUs to Dsco identifier, last time quantity changed)

Projects:
1. What is all of the derived data today? What else should we derive/collect/generate?

2. Business ideas to prove possible/impossible
(e.g., pattern of inventory update, less than once a day, are there correlation when we see that pattern and cancellation of the product; grab all cancelled orders and show what happened before, e.g., inventory was volatile). Sometimes, quantity never changes (e.g., 50 per day every day no matter what). Are there patterns in inventory data (e.g., update), order gets cancelled or shipped, predict cancellation.

Nordstrom - 2% cancellation
Kohl's - 1.2% cancellation
Is this mostly due to Christmas or does it spread across the year?

No inventory
non-changing inventory (really no change or did not update or ...)

Look for patterns for SKUs (e.g., there are 9 patterns across all of the SKUs, each SKU follows one of these patterns). Do any of these patterns have downstream effect?

Per-supplier basis analysis

Inventory visibility - do you even track inventory? (by looking at inventory updates)
